# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a web application that intelligently decomposes complex requests into smaller, manageable sub-requests using AI-powered analysis through Claude Code CLI.

The system creates a hierarchical graph structure starting from a root request, breaking it down through intermediate requests, until reaching atomic requests that cannot be further decomposed.

The application builds and maintains a domain knowledge base that learns terminology, definitions, and concept relationships to continuously improve decomposition accuracy across different domains.

## Requirements

### Request Submission Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to submit a complex request through a web interface, so that the system can analyze and decompose it into manageable sub-tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the web application THEN the system SHALL display a request input interface
2. WHEN a user submits a request THEN the system SHALL accept text input of any reasonable length
3. WHEN a request is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate the input and provide feedback for invalid requests
4. WHEN a valid request is processed THEN the system SHALL initiate the decomposition workflow

### AI-Powered Request Analysis

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to analyze my request using AI intelligence, so that it can understand the context and complexity of what I'm asking for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is received THEN the system SHALL send it to the Claude Code CLI backend for analysis
2. WHEN the backend analyzes a request THEN it SHALL identify key terms, concepts, and relationships
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL store the domain knowledge elements (terms, definitions, relationships)
4. WHEN context gathering is needed THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions to the user
5. IF a request cannot be analyzed THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggestions

### Hierarchical Request Decomposition

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my request broken down into a hierarchical structure, so that I can understand how the system is approaching the problem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is analyzed THEN the system SHALL generate intermediate sub-requests based on the gathered context
2. WHEN sub-requests are generated THEN the system SHALL recursively decompose them until atomic requests are reached
3. WHEN decomposition is complete THEN the system SHALL create a graph structure with root, intermediate, and atomic nodes
4. WHEN the graph is created THEN the system SHALL display it in a visual, interactive format
5. WHEN a user views the graph THEN they SHALL be able to see the relationships between all request levels

### Atomic Request Identification

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to identify when requests cannot be decomposed further, so that I have clear, actionable atomic tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system evaluates a sub-request THEN it SHALL determine if further decomposition is possible
2. WHEN a request cannot be decomposed further THEN the system SHALL mark it as an atomic request
3. WHEN atomic requests are identified THEN they SHALL appear as leaf nodes in the request graph
4. WHEN all decomposition is complete THEN the system SHALL present the final set of atomic requests
5. WHEN atomic requests are displayed THEN each SHALL be clearly actionable and self-contained

### Domain Knowledge Learning

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to maintain a domain knowledge base, so that the system improves its decomposition accuracy over time by learning domain-specific terminology and relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL extract and store key terms, their definitions, and contextual meanings
2. WHEN the AI identifies relationships between concepts THEN the system SHALL store these relationships (e.g., "authentication requires user credentials", "deployment depends on testing")
3. WHEN processing new requests THEN the system SHALL reference stored domain knowledge to inform decomposition decisions
4. WHEN similar terminology appears in future requests THEN the system SHALL apply previously learned definitions and relationships
5. WHEN domain knowledge grows THEN the system SHALL use it to make more accurate decomposition decisions and generate more relevant sub-requests

### Comprehensive Functional Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive functional testing for each new capability, so that the system reliability is maintained throughout development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new feature is implemented THEN functional tests SHALL be created using web browser automation
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL test the real application end-to-end
3. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL validate user workflows from request submission to graph visualization
4. WHEN functionality changes THEN existing tests SHALL be updated to maintain coverage
5. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about what functionality is broken

### Interactive Graph Exploration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the request decomposition results, so that I can explore and understand the generated structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the decomposition graph is displayed THEN users SHALL be able to expand and collapse nodes
2. WHEN a user clicks on a request node THEN the system SHALL show detailed information about that request
3. WHEN viewing node details THEN users SHALL see the reasoning behind the decomposition
4. WHEN exploring the graph THEN users SHALL be able to navigate between parent and child requests
5. WHEN the graph is complex THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and search capabilities
